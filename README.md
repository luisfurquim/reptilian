# Reptilian
PDF reader

This package parses PDF documents and leave to extractors packages the task of generating its information
in another format (like plain text, HTML, etc.)

I started to write this package as I needed to access PDF contents and found no package to do it.
Clearly my research was badly conducted because there is the https://github.com/rsc/pdf package.
Although I just started to check it, it seems to be what I was looking for and the development status
is far ahead from Reptilian.

Anyway, as I started coding Reptilian and already using it in my projects,
I will keep working with it and publishing, just in case someone finds it useful.
I advise that my code was not extensively tested yet.
The only extractor for now is the plain text extractor.
I will write an HTML extractor in some months.
There's almost no comments in the code and no documentation,
this will be fixed with time...

So, at this moment, except if you are working in my projects or are curious to see the code,
Reptilian is just alpha code and probably is not what you are looking for.
